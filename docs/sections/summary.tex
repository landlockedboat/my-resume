\textbf{Eager to learn CS student} passionate about videogame development and transmedia storytelling. I've beed fiddling with code since i realised i had the power to modelate my own worlds with it. Fast learner. I don't mind stepping out of my comfort zone to learn new technologies and techniques if they yield personal growth. Efficient problem solver, good team worker, promoter of good design and elegant coding. My biggest flaw is that i spend maybe a bit too much time on reddit.
